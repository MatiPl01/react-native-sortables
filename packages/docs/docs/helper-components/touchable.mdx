# Touchable

## Overview

React Native Sortables exports a `Touchable` component that properly handles touch gestures within sortable components without interfering with the drag gesture.

### Purpose

The `Touchable` component is designed to:

- Handle various touch gestures (tap, double tap, long press) properly within sortable component items
- Prevent conflicts between touch handling and drag-and-drop functionality

### When to Use?

Use this component when you need to add interactive elements (buttons, links, etc.) inside sortable items. Touch gestures on this component are properly coordinated with the gesture detector used for item activation and dragging.

## Usage

:::info

For the complete usage example, refer to the [Touchable](/grid/examples/touchable) example.

:::

Use the Touchable component within a sortable component's child (item) component.

```tsx
import Sortable from 'react-native-sortables';

// ... other components
<Sortable.Touchable
  onTap={() => {
    console.log('tapped');
  }}
  onLongPress={() => {
    console.log('long pressed');
  }}
  onTouchesDown={() => {
    console.log('touch started');
  }}>
  {/* ... other components */}
</Sortable.Touchable>;
// ... other components
```

## Props

### onTap

Called when the user taps the component.

| type         | default | required |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `() => void` | NO      | NO       |

---

### onLongPress

Called when the user long presses the component.

| type         | default | required |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `() => void` | NO      | NO       |

---

### onTouchesDown

Called when touches begin on the component.

| type         | default | required |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `() => void` | NO      | NO       |

---

### onTouchesUp

Called when touches end on the component.

| type         | default | required |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `() => void` | NO      | NO       |

---

### failDistance

Maximum distance in pixels that a touch can move before the gesture is considered failed.

| type     | default | required |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| `number` | 10      | NO       |

---

### gestureMode

Determines how gestures interact with each other if more than a single callback is provided.

It doesn't impact the drag and drop gesture, which is always handled simultaneously with the touch gesture.

| type                            | default       | required |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| `'exclusive' \| 'simultaneous'` | `'exclusive'` | NO       |

- `'exclusive'` - only one gesture can be active at a time
- `'simultaneous'` - allows multiple gestures to be active simultaneously

---

### Additional Props

The component also accepts all standard React Native `ViewProps` which are passed through to the underlying View component.
