# Portal Provider

## Overview

The **Portal Provider** component allows you to render the active item on top of other components.

It is useful if your sortable component is **deeply nested within other components** and you want to render the active item on top of all of them or if you want to render the active item **outside of the `ScrollView` content bounds**.

## Usage

```tsx
